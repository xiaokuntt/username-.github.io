			  <p class="newsbody">Wang Wanqi, member of the Communist Party of China, graduated from the Marxist College of Guangxi University, is a deputy secretary of the Youth League Committee and secretary of the Party Branch of the College. He served as the vice chairman of the National Federation of Students and the head of the research branch. Since entering the University of Guangxi, he has been involved and led the students to participate in various public welfare practice activities. Especially from July 2014 to August 2015, Wanqi and team members accumulated volunteers for nearly 20,000 hours in the state-level poverty-stricken county Fuchuan Yao Autonomous County, raising funds and love materials totaling more than 260,000 yuan to help left-behind children 3000. Yu Ming. During the period of returning to school, Wanqi unforgettable Yaoxiang children, launched the "Yao Basket Project", raised more than 100,000 yuan to help left children in poverty-stricken areas, and related stories were reported by China Youth Network, People's Daily Online, Guangxi Daily and other media.
              </p> 
			  <p class="newsbody">In fact, the story of Wanqi volunteer service has to start from the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. At that time, he was in class and he organized the classmates to evacuate in an orderly manner. In the process of the final evacuation, he also helped a teacher who was almost fainted and successfully evacuated from the shaking corridor. Thinking of the suffering of the people in the epicenter, he worked hard to write "Announcement of All Teachers and Students" on the night, calling on the teachers and students of the school to dedicate their love and raise more than 60,000 yuan. Due to his outstanding performance in the earthquake relief process, Wanqi was rated as an outstanding student of earthquake relief in the country.

              </p> 
			  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Youth campus, forge ahead</strong>
              </p> 
			  <p class="newsbody"> After coming to the university, Wan Qi resolutely joined the student volunteer organization. I still remember that he and the volunteers went to the depths of the mountains in Dongshui Village, Rongshui County, Liuzhou, to photograph the first photos of the empty nesters. The conditions there are tough, there is no place to live, they are crowded in abandoned primary schools; without water to drink, they take the water from the mountains. Under such extremely difficult conditions, he and his teammates insisted on completing the shooting for hundreds of empty nesters. There were too many hardships and hardships, but when I saw grandparents holding the smile on the photo, Wan Qi felt that all the effort was worth it.

              </p> 
			  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Go deep into the grassroots and take responsibility</strong>
              </p> 
			  <p class="newsbody">Near graduation, Wan Qi can sign a job with an annual salary of 100,000, and can also directly pursue a master's degree. However, he dreamed of going to the west, going to the grassroots, and joining the education cause. In August 2014, he and seven team members went to Fuchuan County to carry out teaching work. As the head of the team, he chose to support the more difficult conditions, leaving more children in Fuchuan Second Middle School. Although he struggled with mice, frogs and palm-sized spiders every night, he grew up in the countryside and did not care about the hardships of the conditions. He just came to the service and he took the usual service enthusiasm. Through the love activities of "Dream University", he and the teachers of the County League Committee raised a total of more than 100,000 yuan to solve the problem of 100 students' tolls.

              </p>  
			  <p class="newsbody">In school, he is both the teacher of the children in the eyes of the children, but also the big brother in the minds of the children. In the mountains of Bucheon, the night is very cold. Once I checked the bed, Wan Qi found that there were many children's bed boards, and only half of them were covered with bedding. After returning to his dormitory, as a class teacher, he turned to the side and could not sleep for a long time. After a night of thinking, he decided to go to the child's home to understand the situation. Wan Qi’s first home visit chose Tunxi Mountain, a fierce wind, and the winding road failed to stop his footsteps. When I arrived at the students' home, I looked at the simple wooden house, the elderly grandparents, and Wan Qi thought: They were the real left-behind children. Later, the home visit became a compulsory course for him and his teammates. In one year, the school has accumulated more than 60 home visits and more than 1,200 kilometers. Their footprints are spread across 12 townships in the county and more than 30 villages.

              </p>  
			  <p class="newsbody">The home visit Zhong Wanqi found that the children did not have extracurricular books and the spiritual life was relatively poor, so Wan Qi went around and collected more than 2,200 books. On this basis, the Education Group has established a “Dream Book House” for a number of local primary schools, and a “weekend class” in the village, which has enriched the children's spiritual world.
