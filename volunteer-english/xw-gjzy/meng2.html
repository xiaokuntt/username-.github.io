				<p class="newsbody">As a medical dog, the usual university life is simple and dull. In the summer vacation before the senior year, I made a crazy decision. I went to Nepal alone to teach. Many people don’t understand why they should go to such a poor country. Health and safety have become a concern for everyone. I think it is worthwhile to try to go to different countries at a young age, to experience the local folk customs, and to take a little change with others. Because I have traveled abroad many times, my parents agreed, and in August I embarked on my own journey.</p>
				<p class="newsbody">Because I arrived early in the morning, I first stayed in Tamil for one night. The next day I went to the camp (white house). I was greeted by prema. She is a member of Greenville. She is very friendly and enters the white house. See Arrived at Rajesh, he is a coordinator in Nepal. Because the name is really difficult to read and lives in his home, we all affectionately call him Papa.</p>
				<p class="newsbody">When I first arrived in Nepal, Jiadu was everywhere dusty. There were no traffic lights at all intersections. Every day, there was a speed of life and death on the road. The bath was cold water. The staple food was a large amount of rice with a little vegetarian food. These made me very uncomfortable. With the beginning of the Cultural Experience Week, learn Nepali, learn about local religious culture, learn to make Nepalese cuisine, and slowly I began to adapt to local life.</p>
			
				<p class="newsbody">One day during the Cultural Week is hiking. In the early morning, we brought some water and chocolate. We set off, passing through the village and passing through the field path. From time to time, we will see several sheep and cows. Chickens and ducks leisurely in the ridge. Walking, because of living in the city, these first time gave me the feeling of being close to nature. The most tired is mountain climbing. There are no stone roads to be repaired in the mountains. We need to go up step by step along the slope of the mountain. All the way to the mountain, the surrounding trees are lush, so there is no special feeling of heat, climbed to the top of the mountain, the whole of Canada has a panoramic view, I want to come here is the fun of Hiking.</p>
				<p class="newsbody">In the second week I chose to go to Pokhara to teach. Although I am mentally prepared, the conditions here will be more difficult. However, when I arrived at the school, I was shocked by the scene. Several boys played on the playground that had not been put on the concrete. Every time they ran, they would raise dust. The teaching building is also very broken. The walls in the room are not even painted, and the desks and chairs are especially low. Seeing that we are here, a few children rushed to us in a special heat and took us to play the game. When I have dinner, the local children will sit around me, with dark lights, shadows on the walls, and flexible to change the animal shape of dogs, rabbits, hawks, crocodiles, etc. This very simple game, they I have a lot of fun, my face is filled with a happy smile. I suddenly have a real feeling that happiness does not necessarily need a very strong material foundation. Looking at their pure smiles, I also insist that I should teach them some here. The determination of knowledge.</p>
				<p class="newsbody">This school is a school from kindergarten to high school. The scope of choice is larger. In the first class, I taught fourth-grade English. I generally feel that their English level is much better than that in China. This is related to their bilingual teaching. There is no pressure, the students in front will be more serious, the students behind will not keep up, and even the books will not open. In the next few days, I mainly teach mathematics from the first grade to the tenth grade. The lower grades still stay in the counting stage of counting fingers. The most obvious feeling in the senior grades is that the polarization is very serious. Some students have done a quick and correct problem. Some even do not know the method.</p>
				
                <p class="newsbody">Because I chose the teaching project, the biggest feeling for me is that Nepal’s investment in education is very big. For example, the students’ school uniforms are very clean and tidy. Ask local people to know that school uniforms may be the best clothes in their lives. School buses are also much better than local buses. These are what we have to learn. Increasing the investment in education for our children is conducive to improving the basic quality of citizens.</p>
