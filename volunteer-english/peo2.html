			  <p class="newsbody">More than 500,000 people with disabilities in Tianjin, because there are no barrier-free buses designed for disabled wheelchairs, this has made many disabled wheelchair users who are inconvenient to move out of the bus. Since late April 2014, the bus group has started to operate barrier-free buses in 100 bus lines in urban areas. As the driver of the first batch of barrier-free vehicles, Hui Jiangtao devoted himself to research and began to improve the service details. Starting from reducing the waiting time for wheelchair passengers and travel services, and turning passive services into active services, Hui Jiangtao printed the first disabled passenger reservation service card for Tianjin Public Transport, creating a precedent for buses to reserve services. To analyze the travel needs of disabled wheelchair passengers, and launch the exclusive project of “Blue Warm, Sunshine Helping Disabled Volunteer Service”. According to the needs of disabled wheelchair users, the volunteer service is divided into on-off help and home help. In the large category, the service radiates 38 stations in four urban areas along the route. For the disabled wheelchair passengers who need to get on and off the bus, they will issue an appointment service card, implement advance reservation, set the scheduled on-time bus service, and issue the appointment service card for the whole year. More than a thousand, booking more than 300 people；For those who need to go to the home to provide disabled wheelchairs, Hui Jiangtao will contact the members of the nearest service team to help the disabled wheelchair users who have come to the door to help them. Since the service was launched, they have helped hundreds of people with disabilities in the past two years. Xiao Zhao, who lives in the Dongli of the Dinglinyuan of Wangding, is such a helper. Xiao Zhao is 23 years old. He can't stand on his legs. He usually relies on wheelchairs. He said: "Since returning to Master to help him to travel by barrier-free bus, his travel is much more convenient, especially the return of the master to my help is really too big. Because it is not convenient to travel by wheelchair, so I used to I rarely go out in peacetime. An occasional chance, let me listen to the radio and say that the barrier-free bus that the master is driving can also make an appointment. Out of curiosity, I reported on the idea of making a phone call and started my first appointment. I didn't expect to return to Master's appointment to make a reservation. Every time he pushed me down and told me the time to return, otherwise I really don't know how to go home.From then on, every time Xiao Zhao travels, he will send back to the master to send an appointment to WeChat in advance. The returning masters and volunteers will also arrive at the station on time; truly expand the volunteer service from the car to the car, and continue to expand the coverage of the disabled. The humanized appointment service has become more and more intimate, and has been greatly recognized and praised by the disabled wheelchair passengers and the public. Everyone has sent back to Jiang Tao’s disability appointment service information through WeChat and Weibo. Many media reports have exceeded 100.

              </p> 
			  <p class="newsbody">In order to meet the needs of different passengers, and let the passengers enjoy the humanized and caring service when traveling, he carefully studied the internal structure of the barrier-free car, and used the space without seats above the front wheel to purchase the small medicine box and emergency.
